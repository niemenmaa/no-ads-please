# no-ads-please
Digital version of the code that prohibits ads flooding to my letterbox.

Soon as I moved to a new apartment the flood of spam, ads, and free newspapers (mostly filled with ads) flooded my apartment. 

My lovely girlfriend made me a sing that I put on the door above the letterbox. No more ads!

Even the code on the sign is pretty impressive for someone who hasn't written HTML since early 2000's virtual stables, I know some of you wanna point out how there is no `<title>` or doctype is not defined or stuff like that.

This repo is the place to do that, and who knows if you are kind enough on your issues, she might be up for a patched version.

### Translation

*ingen reklam!* = no ads! (Swedish)

*kiitos!* = thanks! (Finnish)
